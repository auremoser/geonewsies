####Concept
GeoNewsies is an application that aggregates simple and relevant media for a country, on both standard news and social news tracks. It's designed to inform travelers on the current and qualitative media relevant to their country of destination.

Some goals include:

* provide a simple link list of top media for a place
* ability to search for a country (currently, we're testing with one, but we'd like to scale)
* 2 tracks: mainstream media links + social media links

####Why?
We built this because currently, travel-related resources focus on logistics (currency, language, weather) and general information for destinations; but we wanted to explore qualitative cultural context on a country- by-country basis.

This service will give the user a sense of what's going on in the country they visit, prior to and throughout a travel experience. It pulls standard news media headlines and dates from the Guardian API relative to a country (Most Viewed and Editor's Picks articles from the last 24hours), and the pulls twitter information from that countries' geolocation.
